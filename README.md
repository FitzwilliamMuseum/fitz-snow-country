This repository holds the code and content for the Fitzwilliam Museum's Snow Country Japanese Prints exhibition:
Japanese artists have long responded to an altered world of frozen forms, stilled by a blanket of snow. In woodcuts they used blank paper to convey the purifying beauty of snow in a transformed landscape where even ‘the depths of the night became white’.
